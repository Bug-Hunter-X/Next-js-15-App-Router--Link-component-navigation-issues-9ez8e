# Next.js 15 App Router: Link Component Navigation Issues

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using the `Link` component for client-side navigation.  In certain scenarios, navigation may fail to work as expected, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The issue revolves around the inconsistent behavior of the `Link` component within the App Router's context.  While it generally functions correctly, there are cases where clicking the link does not trigger the expected navigation. This can be affected by factors such as specific routing configurations, nested layouts, or client-side interactions.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the `Link` component.  Navigation might fail in unexpected scenarios.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing your routing configuration and potential conflicts with client-side navigation.  Ensuring your routes are correctly defined and that there are no conflicts with layout components or other dynamic aspects of your application is crucial.

Sometimes adjusting the `prefetch` property of the `Link` component to `false` can help. In more complex scenarios, additional debugging might be needed.
